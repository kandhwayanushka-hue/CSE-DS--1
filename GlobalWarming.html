               <i>Global warming is the long-term increase in Earth average surface temperature, primarily caused by human 
                activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. It leads to environmental and societal consequences 
                such as melting glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss. This phenomenon 
                poses risks to food security, water resources, and public health. Urgent action is needed to mitigate global
                warming.</i>

            <h2><b><u>Causes of Global Warming</u></b></h2>
            <p><u><b>Greenhouse Gases Are the Main Reasons for Global Warming</u></b>
            Although carbon dioxide receives the most press as the culprit responsible for global warming, water vapor is 
            actually the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide still deserves its notoriety
            ,however. It may be a minor component of the atmosphere, but its increased abundance is contributing to the 
            warming trend, according to NASA. Humans exacerbate the problem by cutting trees that absorb this gas and by 
            adding other greenhouse gases to the mixture over and above those that enter through natural processes.

            <ul type disc><li>Cause #1:<STRONG><u>Variations in the Sun's Intensity</u></STRONG><br></li>
             <EM>The Earth receives its warmth from the sun, so it's reasonable to suspect that our home star may be one of the
             reasons for global warming. Although the amount of energy coming from the sun does vary and may have been
             responsible for warming in the past, however, NASA and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have 
             ruled this out as a cause of the current warming trend. The average energy coming from the sun generally has
             remained constant since 1750, and the warming does not occur uniformly throughout the atmosphere. The upper layer
             is actually cooling as the bottom layer becomes warmer.</EM><br>

             <br>
            <li>Cause #2:<b><u>Industrial Activity</u></b></li>
            <i>Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been burning fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum for energy, which 
            releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A quarter of this is for heat and electricity, while another quarter is
            for other industrial processes and transportation, which includes gasoline- or diesel-powered cars, trucks, trains 
            and airplanes. The other half of the energy is used for various other purposes, including agriculture, 
            cement production and oil and gas production. These processes also release other greenhouse gases, such as methane 
            and CFCs, although the concentration of CFCs has declined since their use was banned in 1988.</i><br>

            <li>Cause #3:<b><u>Agricultural Activity</u></b></li>
            <i>The agricultural practices that produce food for the people on earth is another of the human causes of climate change. 
            The use of both commercial and organic fertilizers releases nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas. Methane, another
             important greenhouse gas, comes from many natural sources, but also from the digestive systems of livestock raised 
             for meat production as well as the decomposition of waste in landfills and the burning of biomass.</i><br>

            <br>
            <li><b><u>Cause #4: Deforestation</u></b></li>
            <i>The increased demand for meat and dairy cattle has lead to the creation of feed lots in otherwise forested areas. 
            Logging for wood and paper and clearing for crop production also requires trees to be cut, sometimes illegally. 
            One mature tree absorbs as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each year, and by one estimate, 3.5 to 7 billion
            are cut every year. According to Scientific American, deforestation is responsible for 15 percent of the
            greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</i><br>

            <br>
            <li><b><u>Cause #5: Earth's Own Feedback Loop</u></b></li>
            <i>As the atmosphere warms, it is able to hold more water, which is already the most abundant greenhouse gas. 
            This creates a feedback loop that accelerates global warming. It also creates more clouds, rainstorms and
            other symptoms of climate change. At the poles, the warming of the atmosphere melts the ice cover,
            exposing water, which is less reflective than ice. The water absorbs the sun's heat, and the oceans 
            also become warmer as a result.</i><br></ul></p>

        <a name="Effects of Global Warming">
        <p><u>Global warming has a range of effects on the environment and human society. Some of the most significant effects include:</u><br>
            <ul type square><li>Rising Temperatures: Global warming leads to increased average temperatures worldwide, resulting in more frequent and intense heatwaves.</li>
            <li>Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels: The warming of the planet causes polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising sea levels. This can lead to coastal flooding and erosion.</li>
            <li>Extreme Weather Events: Global warming is associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and heavy rainfall.</li>
            <li>Disruption of Ecosystems: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can disrupt ecosystems, affecting plant and animal species. Some species may face extinction if they cannot adapt or migrate.</li>
            <li>Impact on Agriculture: Shifts in climate can affect crop yields and food production, leading to food insecurity in some regions.</li>
            <li>Health Risks: Global warming can exacerbate health issues, including heat-related illnesses, respiratory problems due to poor air quality, and the spread of vector-borne diseases.</li>
            <li>Ocean Acidification: Increased carbon dioxide levels lead to ocean acidification, which can harm marine life, particularly coral reefs and shellfish.</li></ul></p>

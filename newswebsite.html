        <h2>“Today’s IPCC report on the physical science basis of climate change unfortunately reiterated with even greater certainty that human-induced climate change is now happening faster and more intensely than predicted in their Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C,”
             said Gino Van Begin, Secretary General of ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability."</h2>

            <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS</a><br>
        </h3> <br><hr>
        <font size="+1">
             <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a new report, Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis, which brings together the most recent advances in climate science to outline the current state of climate change. The results are grave.

The opening line of the report’s Summary for Policymakers reads: “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.” 

The report, which was approved by 195 national governments, shows the rapid human-induced change that is occurring in our climate. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is the highest it has been in 2 million years, sea level rise is at its fastest in 3000 years and arctic
 sea ice is at its lowest levels in at least 1000 years.

“We now have a much clearer picture of the past, present and future climate, which is essential for understanding where we are headed, what can be done, and how we can prepare,” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, Co-Chair of Working Group I, which made this contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report.

<p>We are already seeing the effects of human-induced climate change around the globe. Extreme weather events, from wildfires across North America and Southern Europe to extreme flooding in China and Western Europe, and devastating tropical cyclones on the Indian and Atlantic coasts, show the real life consequences 
    of a climate that has already warmed by 1.1 °C since the mid-1800s.</p>

<h2><u><b>The role of local and regional governments in holding the line on 1.5°C</b></u></h2>


              <p> <i>“Today’s IPCC Working Group 1 Report is code red for humanity.  The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk,” said António Guterres,
                 United Nations Secretary General. “The viability of our societies depends on 
                leaders from government, business and civil society uniting behind policies, actions and investments that will limit temperature rise to 1.5°C,” he continued.

This call to action from the UN Secretary General only reinforces the critical importance of multilevel collaboration in tackling the climate crisis. No city, region, or nation can continue in a business-as-usual mode. We must be planning and acting for the state of emergency we are currently in. </i>

The reports provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments on climate change, its present implications and future risks,
